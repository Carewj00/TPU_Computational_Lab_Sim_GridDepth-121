# TPU Ontology: L0 and L1  
**tpu_output_V56c_auto**

This folder represents the earliest stage of the TPU Computational Lab simulations.  
It captures the behaviours from which we infer the two foundational layers of the TPU ontology:

- **L0 — The Void**
- **L1 — The Primordial Field**

These layers are not directly simulated numerically.  
They are *deduced* from the earliest observable behaviours in the simulation output.

## L0 — The Void  
L0 represents a state with **no structure and no physics**:

- no fields  
- no vacuum  
- no geometry  
- no energy  
- no excitations  
- no fluctuations  

This is **true nothingness**, not the quantum vacuum.  
Quantum theory has no equivalent to L0.

L0 is the baseline from which the universe emerges.

---

## L1 — The Primordial Field  
L1 is the first “something” above the Void.

It is inferred from the earliest simulation behaviour: 

- a spark‑like energy release  
- instantaneous replication at the boundary with the Void  
- formation of a stable, bonded field  
- emergence of a medium capable of supporting excitations  
- long‑term stability across cosmic timescales  

The Primordial Field is the **substrate** of the universe ( a 3D mesh of the smallest most powerful thing in the universe)
It is more fundamental than the quantum vacuum and has no direct quantum equivalent.
( suspect it’s an energy field in 3D mesh form that gives rise to electric when matter is agitated, also susoect it bonds to Atoms and is deformed by dense matter giving rise to gravity why things fall, why matter cannot reach the speed of light as its anchored and would heat and dechoere on acceleration  )

## Relationship to Higher Layers  
From L1, the ontology proceeds as follows:

- **L2 — Primordial Field + Excitations**  
  (first vacuum‑like behaviour)

- **L3 — Structures from Excitations**  
  (proto‑objects, stable patterns)

- **L4 — Atoms**  
  (first bound states)

- **L5 — Matter**  
  (bulk classical matter)

- **L6 — Cosmology**  
  (large‑scale structure)

- **L7 — Observable Universe**  
  (observer‑dependent view)

This folder (`tpu_output_V56c_auto`) anchors the entire ladder by capturing the earliest behaviours that imply the existence of L0 and L1.

## Purpose of This Folder  
- Acts as the **conceptual root** of the TPU ontology  
- Provides the **interpretive basis** for L0 and L1  
- Links the simulation’s earliest outputs to the theoretical foundation  
- Ensures the full L0–L7 structure is explicit and documented
